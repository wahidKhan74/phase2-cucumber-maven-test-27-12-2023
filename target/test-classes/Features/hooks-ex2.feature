Feature: Test Hooks with Senario Outline
  I want to use this template for my feature file

  Scenario Outline: Title of your scenario outline
    Given I want to write a step with precondition
    And some other precondition
    When I complete action
    Then I validate the outcomes
    And check more outcomes

    Examples: 
      | Scenario |
      | First    |
      | Second   |
      | Third    |
